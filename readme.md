# Aamon's DWM config

I am currently just getting it to the world of tiling window managers, so here we are, my dwm config!!!

This is the very beginning of this config, so as for setup it's pretty simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm.git
sudo make istall
sudo cp dwm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
```

This is very much a work in progress so check in frequently as lots may change.

## My plans todo:

- get autostart patch
- get restart patch
- get uslessgaps patch
- get cycle layout patch
- themes
- get layouts I like
