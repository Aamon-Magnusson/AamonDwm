# Aamon's DWM config

I am currently just getting it to the world of tiling window managers, so here we are, my dwm config!!!

This is the very beginning of this config, so as for setup it's pretty simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm.git
cd AamonDwm # or whatever you named the directory
sudo make istall
sudo cp CopyFiles/dwm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
cp CopyFiles/conky.conf ~/.config/conky
chmod +x Copyfiles/sutostart.sh
cp Copyfiles/autostart.sh ~/.dwm
```

This is very much a work in progress so check in frequently as lots may change.

For a basic display of the keybindings hit SUPER + o. (It'll show in dmenu)

## My plans todo:

- themes
- get layouts I like
