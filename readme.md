# Aamon's DWM config

I am currently just gettig it to the world of tiling window managers, so here we are, my dwm config!!!

This is the very beginning of this config, so as for setup it's pretty simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm.git
sudo make istall
cp dwm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
```

This is very much a work in progress so check in frequently as much may change
