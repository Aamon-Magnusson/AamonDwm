# My Slock config

Here is my slock config. Not sure why anyone would need it, but it works the way I like.

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonSlock.git
cd AamonSlock # or whatever you called it
./install.sh
```

This config should always be compiled using `install.sh` as that is where so regex is done to correct the user name.

the `-h` option can show options
